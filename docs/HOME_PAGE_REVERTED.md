# Home Page Reverted to Packages View

## ✅ Issue Fixed

The home page (`/`) now correctly displays the packages selection page for hotspot users.

## 🔧 What Was Changed

### File: `frontend/src/router/index.js`

**Before (Wrong):**
```javascript
import PublicView from '@/views/public/HomeView.vue'
```
- Was importing a simple landing page
- Not useful for hotspot users

**After (Correct):**
```javascript
import PublicView from '@/views/public/PackagesView.vue'
```
- Now imports the packages selection page
- Shows available WiFi packages to hotspot users

## 📋 What Happened

During the frontend reorganization, I mistakenly replaced the `HomeView.vue` content with a simple landing page. The original packages view was preserved as `PackagesView.vue` but wasn't being used as the home page.

## ✅ What the Home Page Shows Now

### For Hotspot Users (`/`):
- ✅ **TraidNet WiFi Packages** header
- ✅ **Device MAC address** display
- ✅ **Available packages** with pricing
- ✅ **Package selection** functionality
- ✅ **Payment integration** (M-Pesa)
- ✅ **Loading states** and error handling

### Features:
- Sticky header with branding
- Package cards with details
- Duration and price information
- Buy button for each package
- Device identification
- Responsive design
