# Quick Fix Summary

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. 401 Unauthorized Error - FIXED ✅

**Problem:**
```
POST http://localhost/api/packages 401 (Unauthorized)
Error: "Received 401 on public endpoint, clearing stale token"
```

**Root Cause:**
Axios interceptor treated ALL `/packages` requests as public, so POST/PUT/DELETE didn't send Authorization header.

**Solution:**
Changed `main.js` to be method-aware:
```javascript
// BEFORE
const publicEndpoints = ['login', 'packages', ...]

// AFTER
const publicEndpoints = [
  'login',
  'GET:packages',  // Only GET is public
  ...
]
```

**Result:**
- ✅ GET /packages → Public (no auth)
- ✅ POST /packages → Requires auth (sends token)
- ✅ PUT /packages/{id} → Requires auth (sends token)
- ✅ DELETE /packages/{id} → Requires auth (sends token)

### 2. Schedule Feature - IMPLEMENTED ✅

**Requirement:**
When "Enable Schedule" is checked, user should select activation time.

**Implementation:**
- ✅ DateTime picker appears when schedule enabled
- ✅ Prevents selecting past dates
- ✅ Backend validation (must be future time)
- ✅ Database field added
- ✅ Full CRUD support

**UI:**
```
☐ Enable Schedule
  ↓ (when checked)
☑ Enable Schedule
  📅 Activation Time: [2025-10-25 18:00] *
  ℹ️ Package will be activated at the specified time
```
