# Router Provisioning - Testing Without Physical Router

## 🎯 Understanding the Flow

When you create a router, the system:

1. ✅ Creates router in database
2. ✅ Generates MikroTik configuration script
3. ⏳ **Waits for router to connect** (you're here)
4. ⏳ Discovers interfaces
5. ⏳ Completes provisioning

## ⚠️ Why It's "Stuck"

The system is **NOT stuck** - it's waiting for you to:
1. Copy the generated configuration
2. Apply it to your MikroTik router
3. The router connects back to the system

**This is expected behavior for production use!**

## 🧪 Testing Without Physical Router

### Option 1: Mark Router as Online (Quick Test)

Use the bypass script:

```powershell
# Mark router as online
.\scripts\mark-router-online.ps1 2

# The provisioning modal will automatically proceed
```

### Option 2: Update Database Manually

```powershell
# Connect to database
docker exec -it traidnet-postgres psql -U admin -d wifi_hotspot

# Mark router as online
UPDATE routers SET status = 'online', last_seen = NOW() WHERE id = 2;

# Exit
\q
```

### Option 3: Close and Continue Later

The router is created successfully! You can:
1. Close the provisioning modal
2. The router appears in your router list
3. You can configure it later when you have physical hardware

## 📊 What Happens Next

After marking as online:
1. ✅ System detects router is online
2. ✅ Discovers interfaces
3. ✅ Completes provisioning
4. ✅ Router ready for service configuration

## 🎯 Production Flow

In production with real MikroTik:

```
1. Create Router
   ↓
2. Copy Configuration Script
   ↓
3. Login to MikroTik via Winbox/SSH
   ↓
4. Paste and run the script
   ↓
5. Router connects back
   ↓
6. System auto-discovers interfaces
   ↓
7. Provisioning complete!
```

## 🔧 Current Status

**Router Created:** ✅ Yes (ID: 2, Name: ggn-hsp-01)  
**Configuration Generated:** ✅ Yes  
**Waiting For:** Router to come online  
**Current Status:** `probing` (checking connectivity)  

## 📝 Quick Commands

**Check router status:**
```sql
SELECT id, name, status, last_seen FROM routers WHERE id = 2;
```

**Mark as online:**
```powershell
.\scripts\mark-router-online.ps1 2
```

**View all routers:**
```sql
SELECT id, name, status, ip_address FROM routers;
```

## ✅ Summary

**Issue:** Not stuck - waiting for router connection  
**Solution:** Use bypass script for testing  
**Production:** Apply config to real MikroTik  

**For testing, run:**
```powershell
.\scripts\mark-router-online.ps1 2
```

**The provisioning will continue automatically!** 🚀
