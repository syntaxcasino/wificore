# Missing Steps Investigation

## 🔍 Current State

### Home Page (`/`) - PackagesView.vue

**Current Flow:**
```
User visits /
    ↓
Immediately sees packages
    ↓
Selects package
    ↓
Payment modal opens
    ↓
Completes payment
```

**Current Imports:**
```javascript
import { usePackages } from '@/composables/data/usePackages'  // ← Updated path
import PackageCard from '@/components/packages/PackageCard.vue'
import PaymentModal from '@/components/payment/PaymentModal.vue'
```

**Original Imports (from git history):**
```javascript
import { usePackages } from '@/composables/usePackages'  // ← Old path
import PackageCard from '@/components/packages/PackageCard.vue'
import PaymentModal from '@/components/payment/PaymentModal.vue'
```

## ❓ What's Missing?

Based on your description, there should be **steps before the packages** are shown.

### Possible Missing Steps:

1. **Welcome/Landing Step?**
   - Introduction screen
   - Terms and conditions
   - Device detection

2. **Device Registration Step?**
   - Enter device details
   - Verify MAC address
   - Select device type

3. **User Information Step?**
   - Name
   - Phone number
   - Email

4. **Package Selection Step** (Current - exists)
   - View packages
   - Select package

5. **Payment Step** (Current - exists)
   - Enter M-Pesa number
   - Complete payment

## 🔍 Files Searched

### Not Found:
- ❌ No Step components (Step1.vue, Step2.vue, etc.)
- ❌ No Wizard component
- ❌ No multi-step flow component
- ❌ No stepper/progress indicator

### Found:
- ✅ PackagesView.vue - Shows packages directly
- ✅ PaymentModal.vue - Handles payment
- ✅ PackageCard.vue - Displays package
- ✅ DeviceCreation.vue - Device management (admin, not public)

## 📊 Git History Check

### Commits Checked:
- `b6c0099` - feature-payment
- `0abb1a2` - Update PackagesView.vue
- Earlier commits

### Findings:
- PackagesView has always shown packages directly
- No multi-step wizard found in history
- Route `/` has always pointed to PublicView or PackagesView

## 💡 Possible Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Steps Were in a Different Branch
The multi-step flow might exist in a different branch that wasn't merged.

### Scenario 2: Steps Were in a Different File
The steps might have been in a file that was deleted during reorganization.

### Scenario 3: Steps Were Planned But Not Implemented
The multi-step flow might have been planned but not yet implemented.

### Scenario 4: Steps Are in Backend/Router Logic
The steps might be handled by MikroTik router redirect logic, not in the frontend.

## 🎯 What We Need

To restore the missing steps, we need to know:

1. **How many steps were there?**
   - Step 1: ?
   - Step 2: ?
   - Step 3: Package selection
   - Step 4: Payment

2. **What did each step contain?**
   - What information was collected?
   - What UI elements were shown?
   - What validation was performed?

3. **Where was the step logic?**
   - Separate components?
   - Single component with v-if?
   - Router-based navigation?

4. **What triggered progression?**
   - Next/Previous buttons?
   - Automatic progression?
   - Form validation?

## 📝 Current Import Path Issue

### The Only Change Found:
```javascript
// OLD (before reorganization)
import { usePackages } from '@/composables/usePackages'

// NEW (after reorganization)
import { usePackages } from '@/composables/data/usePackages'
```

This is just a path update from the reorganization. The functionality is the same.

## ✅ What's Currently Working

### PackagesView.vue:
- ✅ Fetches packages from API
- ✅ Displays packages in grid
- ✅ Shows device MAC address
- ✅ Handles package selection
- ✅ Opens payment modal
- ✅ Processes payment
- ✅ Handles success/error states

### No Steps/Wizard:
- ❌ No step indicator
- ❌ No progress bar
- ❌ No Next/Previous buttons
- ❌ No multi-page flow

## 🔧 To Fix This

We need more information:

1. **Describe the missing steps**
   - What was shown in each step?
   - What data was collected?

2. **Provide a reference**
   - Screenshot?
   - Description of the flow?
   - Another similar implementation?

3. **Check if it exists elsewhere**
   - Different branch?
   - Different repository?
   - Documentation?

## 📚 Files to Check

If you can provide:
- Old screenshots
- Flow diagrams
- Requirements document
- Another branch name
- Backup files

We can restore the multi-step flow.

## 🎯 Next Steps

Please clarify:
1. What were the steps before package selection?
2. Where might this code be located?
3. Do you have any reference or backup?

**Status:** Awaiting clarification on missing steps  
**Current State:** Packages shown directly without preceding steps  
**Action Needed:** Describe or locate the missing step components
