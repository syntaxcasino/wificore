## ❌ Critical Issues Found

### **Issue #1: Bridge Removal Breaks Connectivity** ⚠️

**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Impact:** Complete loss of router access  
**Affected:** Router 1 & Router 2 (both offline)

**Problem:**
Removing and recreating bridges during deployment breaks active network connections, making routers unreachable.

**Attempts Made:**
1. ❌ Remove all bridge ports → Router offline
2. ❌ Remove only our bridge ports → Router STILL offline
3. ✅ Non-destructive approach → **FIX IMPLEMENTED**

**Solution Implemented:**
```routeros
# OLD (BROKEN):
/interface bridge port remove [find bridge="br-hotspot-1"]
/interface bridge remove [find name="br-hotspot-1"]
/interface bridge add name=br-hotspot-1

# NEW (FIXED):
:do { /interface bridge add name=br-hotspot-1 } on-error={}
:do { /interface bridge port add bridge=br-hotspot-1 interface=ether2 } on-error={}
```

**Status:** ✅ Fix implemented, awaiting test

---

### **Issue #2: Walled Garden Script Import Failure**

**Severity:** HIGH  
**Impact:** Walled garden rules not configured

**Problem:**
MikroTik script import has issues with walled garden commands, even with correct syntax.

**Solution:**
Removed walled garden from script. Will be configured via API after deployment.

**Status:** ✅ Workaround implemented

## 📋 Recovery Required

### **Immediate Actions:**

1. **Recover Router 1 (txn-hsp-01)**
   - Access via VirtualBox console
   - Remove bridge configuration
   - Restore management access
   - Verify connectivity

2. **Recover Router 2 (mrn-hsp-01)**
   - Same procedure as Router 1

3. **Test Non-Destructive Deployment**
   - Deploy to recovered router
   - Verify connectivity maintained
   - Confirm all components created
   - Test idempotency

## 🎓 Key Learnings

### **1. Bridge Management is Critical**
- Never remove active bridges
- Use non-destructive updates only
- Test on disposable routers first

### **2. MikroTik Script Limitations**
- Not all commands work in `.rsc` files
- Error messages can be misleading
- Test commands individually

### **3. Testing Strategy**
- Incremental testing essential
- Have console access ready
- Always have rollback plan

### **4. Production Readiness**
- Idempotent scripts required
- Non-destructive updates only
- Connectivity must be maintained
